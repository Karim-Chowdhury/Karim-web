            <p>The computer programming profession is one that has become crucial in today’s technology-driven world. Programmers create, fix and maintain the software and operating systems that all computer systems rely on, from desktop PCs to smartphones, laptops and other mobile devices. These professionals test programs for bugs, fix any errors that may pop up in code, and write updates for existing programs.</p>

         <p>Computer programmers can earn anywhere from an associate’s degree to a master’s degree to reach some of the best computer programming jobs in today’s marketplace.  Computer programming degrees include software development, information technology, computer systems, and more.  Students may also consider pursuing a minor outside of computer science to add to their CS major to expand their career versatility.  If you are already working in the industry and want to pursue a degree, consider an online computer science degree or certificate program.</p>
